- **PATCH Endpoint**: Partially update an existing cosmetic by providing its ID and the specific fields to update in the request body.
- **DELETE Endpoint**: Delete an existing cosmetic from the store by providing its ID.
- **Additional Actions**: The API also includes additional endpoints for updating ratings and episodes for TV shows.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The backend of the API is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Express.js is used as the web application framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used for writing the server-side code, providing type safety and enhanced developer experience.
- **Postman**: Postman is used for testing the API endpoints and verifying their functionality.
- **GitHub**: GitHub is used for version control and collaboration on the project.

## Usage

To use the API, clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies using npm. You can then start the server using the `npm start` command. The API endpoints can be tested using tools like Postman.
